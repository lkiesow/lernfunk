Lernfunk-Matterhorn-Search-Service-Proxy
===============================================================================

This software is part of the lernfunk-project, an open source media
distribution layer for audio-visual content and more.

It is free software available under the terms of the GPLv3.

===============================================================================

The purpose of this plugin is to combine any number of Matterhorn search
endpoints into a single one and at the same time enforce the lernfunk access
rights in a way, that only recordings that should be available in public are
available in public.


Requirements:
 - Apache with mod_python
 - Cron
 - Lernfunk database

Installation:
 - Put all files into one apache directory and enable mod_python for the .py
	files or at least for “proxy.py”.
 - Deny the access to all files which sould not be available (at least series/*
	and episodes/*). If mod_python is enabled for “accumulate_data.py” is will
	only provide the date of the last update and not the configuration details.
	If not, make shour your database access configuration is protected.
 - Make “accumulate_data.py” executable.
 - Edit “accumulate_data.py” and insert the lernfunk database access data and
	the search service URLs to get the data from.
 - Make cron execute “accumulate_data.py” in regular time steps to
	automatically update the data. For an example see “crontab.txt”.
